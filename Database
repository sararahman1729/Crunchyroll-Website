I loved the one thing about this show is Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has shown profound character development of each of its characters including Maria Ross to chimeras like Zumpano.', 4),
(3, '4 star', 'Once you start, you just can\'t stop watching because of the thrill and anticipation! The plot-twists were very captivating and the switch between present and past to explain certain parts was done appropriately.', 4),
(4, '4 star', 'Even though it\'s just an anime, a fiction, even though an ideal world is impossible but still \" ???? \" has taught me many things.\r\n\r\nNo matter how smart you are, no matter how intelligent you may be, no matter how strong you are, no matter how talented you may be,If you don\'t have the good in your heart,you will never attain inner peace nor the eternal peace around your loved ones.', 5),

The reason is, it carries the emotion of friendship, trust, and most importantly immense determination to surpass one\'s limit and reach another peak. I am simply grateful for such a beautiful script and a series of emotions.', 10),
(8, '3', 'wholesome thing about the show is the saying that they have about fighting for humanity and putting their hearts on the line to protect and save humanity from extinction from these beasts but you\'ll soon find the biggest twist on how they came to be. overall it was good, but didn\'t amaze me like it used to do in earlier seasons', 8),
(9, '4 star', 'This is one of the best shows that i have ever watched. There are so many heart pounding moments (spoiler alert) like when the guy covered in scars takes Nezuko\'s box into the shade and stabs her and cuts himself to prove that she\'s a bloodthirsty demon and the entire time you have to remember how to breathe because you just want her to win the fight!', 9),
(10, '5 star', 'BEST MY FAVORITE !!! \nI don\'t really know how to put my feelings into words . First of all I don\'t know why people hate first ten episodes of this series they were very interesting . This series takes real - life time travel incidents and then build up a awesome story . ', 3);
